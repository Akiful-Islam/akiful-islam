## A little about me

An aspiring software engineer, game developer, and enthusiast designer. Currently, I'm a student at IICT, SUST, seeking a bachelor's in software engineering. I've had a fascination for video games since I was a wee boy and for as far back as I can remember I always wanted to make my own games. My areas of interest include Unity Engine, Unreal Engine, and Frontend Design.

Aside from computer science, I'm also quite interested in developing my creative abilities and studying new artistic things. Because I get so much knowledge from the entertainment I consume, I love engaging in them.
